## Purpose:
The intention of this website and any services offered therein are solely for the purpose of "training" (instructing, teaching, coaching) investors to empower them to be the best traders/investors they can be, and not for the purpose of taking control of their trading/investing in selling advice and bad habits. As with anything that I do, 20% of proceeds will be dedicated to charity at the end of each year. 

## Your (the User's) Responsibility:
Any information that you gain from this are solely for your use however you see fit. Any decisions you make thereof are your own. Anything told, shared, informed in any way, in this manner are not to be taken as a reason to invest at all in any way shape or form (not to "get Long" or "get Short", i.e.: buying options, buying stock, buying ETFs, buying bonds, or any form of financial investing). Any investments taken by You, the End User, are your responsibility, coming from your choices, from information you sought out. All [project name] has provided is information to help you form your decision, not make it.
